# Cumulative Harry Potter fanfiction on AO3

Code for the paper [Cultural accumulation and improvement in online fan fiction](Pianzola_Acerbi_Rebora_2020.pdf)
presented at the CHR2020 workshop.

The folder [/data](data) contains the Rdata file that we used. The CSV format
is hosted on an [external repository](https://osf.io/frm5n/), due to GitHub file size limit.

This repository contains a submodule [/linked-potter](https://github.com/fedormyskin/Linked-Potter/tree/6426c34977f838d4171ffe18b4e4dcc9c66c1bf1), if you clone
it you need to load the submodule content, too. This is not automatically done 
by `git clone`, you need to run `git submodule init` in the terminal.
